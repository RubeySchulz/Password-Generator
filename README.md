##password-generator

#week 3 challenge

using javascript and prewritten HTML and CSS, I made a password generator that asks you if you want
-lowercase
-uppercase
-numbers
or 
-special characters

and took input for the min and max of the password length

then spit out a password that met all of that criteria.
